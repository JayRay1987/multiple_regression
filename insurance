#is the expenses normally distributed?
summary(insurance$expenses)

#data is right-skewed distribution.
#regression requires all features to be numeric.

#correlation of numeric features
cor(insurance[c("age", "bmi", "children", "expenses")])
#age and bmi have a weak positive correlation.
#age and expenses has a moderate positive correlation.
#bmi and expenses has a moderate positive correlation.
#children and expenses has a moderate positive correlation.
#scatterplot matrix
pairs(insurance[c("age","bmi","children","expenses")])
#more informative scatterplot matrix.
#correlation ellipse - provides a viz of correlation strength.
#dot is the mean.
#correlation is indicated by the shape of ellipse.
#more stretched, stronger the correlation.
#if perfectly oval indicates v. weak correlation.
#the loess curve indicates the general relationship between variables.
#for example, age and expenses shows a red line with a slight incline.
#indicating the moderate correlation between the two variables.

#beta coefficients indicate the estimated increase in expenses for an increase of one
#in each of the features, assuming all other values are held constant.
#example, for each additional year of age, we expect $256.8 higher medical bill on average.
#moreover, each additional child results in an average increase of $475.7 on the medical
#bill per year.
#each increase unit of increase in BMI results in an increase of $339.3 on the medical bill
#per year.
#sexmale, smokeryes, are interpretted relative to the reference.
#example, the variables left out are the reference variable - smokerno, sexfemale.
#so males on average pay $131.4 less than females each year.
#smokers pay an average $23947.5 more than non smokers per year.
summary(ins_model)
#residuals is the True value minus the Predicted value. thus maximum error was 29981.7.
#so model under-predicted expenses by nearly $30,000 for at least one observation.
#50% of errors fell between 1Q and 3Q, that is -$2850.9 over the true value and $1383.9
#under the true value.
#Coeeficients. p-value and significance is the most importance part. 
#small p-value - Less than 0 is *** - indicates that feature is extremely unlikely
#to not have a relationship with the dependent variable.
#means very significant. So, age, children, bmi, and smoker coef are stats significantly
#R-squared value indicates how well the model as a whole explains the variation in the
#dependent variable.
#so the model describes 75% of the variation in the dependent variable.
#R-squared adjusted value penalises the model for the number of independent variables
#used. so we can confidently say that the model describes 75% of the variation in the
#dependent variable.
#to improve model and account for the non-linear relationship lets introduce a polynomial.
insurance$age2 <- insurance$age^2
#also let's convert a numeric variable to a binary indicator
#for BMI we will have a binary operator so say if someone is obese or not.

#interaction in the features. two features having a combined effect is known as inter-
#action.
#use expenses ~ bmi30*smoker to represent this interation. This means you include
#bmi30 + smokeryes + bmi30:smokeryes.
#with these three improvements to the data frame lets see how the model fares.
#(1) added a non-linear term for age
#(2) created an indicator for obesity
#(3) specified an interaction between obesity and smoking
ins_model2 <- lm(expenses ~ age + age2 + children + bmi + sex + bmi30*smoker + region, data = insurance)
summary(ins_model2)
#maximum residual error is $24161.6. so at least one prediction was $24,161.6 less than
#the true value.
#minimum residul error is -$17297.1. so at least one prediction was $17297.1 greater than
#the true value.
#50% of the errors fell between -$1656.0 (1Q) and -$727.8 (3Q). Both over estimates of
#the true value.
#age2, children, bmi, smokeryes, regionsouthwest, bmi30:smokeryes were statistically
#significantly and thus more than likely have a relationship with the dependent variable.
#finally, from adjusted r squared value, we see that 86% of the model explains the
#variation in the dependent variable, the medical costs.
#for instance, bmi30:smokeryes sees a large increase in medical bills on average per year.
#namely, $19810.15.
